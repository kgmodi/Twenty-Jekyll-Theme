<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Why the trip?</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.someawesome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/pink-cloud-why.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.someawesome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/pink-cloud-why.gif" height="213" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: left;">T<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">he most elementary and vital question was why do we want to do this trip? I should have started of the blog with this.But honestly these thought were more preeminent as we thought more of the trip and asked ourselves why are we embarking this journey.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It appeared crazy and meaningless to some.Quitting jobs, wasting money, unnecessary exposing one selves to dangers were the few of varied responses we got from people.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">But in our heads and hearts we knew why we wanted to do the journey.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Kunal:</span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The idea for this&nbsp;journey was born when Kunal drove an ambulance from London, UK to Bamako, Mali 4 years ago along with 3 other team mates as part of Timbuktu Challenge.&nbsp;<a href="http://lastresponders.org/timbuktuchallenge2012.html">http://lastresponders.org/timbuktuchallenge2012.html</a></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">He wanted to travel back to his homeland in similar manner. He wanted to mimic the silk route. The idea of driving across borders fascinated Kunal.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Timbuktu Challenge had generated the spark for adventure and travel in him and had convinced him that ordinary people can also pull off a seemingly impossible task and work towards a charitable cause.</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; white-space: pre;"> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Devanshi (Me):</span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Born and raised in Mumbai I had moved to the United States year and a half back. I was working in Midtown Manhattan for last 8 months as a Physical Therapist and met a varied diverse population and encountered different cultures and people with varied mind sets. Things which appeared obvious or natural to me were strange to them and vice versa. It was an amazing experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I learned a lot in this time frame.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I wonder what will be out to explore more in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I have no experience of long trips and I am a novice driver.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">A sense to explore the different cultures, meeting different people and learning something new drives me. I am ready to face unforeseen challenges and face them.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Shrida:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Sole purpose and mission of Shrida about driving was to work for a cause. She has ran many half marathons and 10 ks to raise&nbsp;awareness for a charity. She is clear in her head the purpose of her journey. She firmly believes in giving back to the community in a humble way.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">.She mentioned that as she drives across miles,talking to hundreds of people about her project and mission,she would be sowing a seed of goodness in that individuals mind. "Even if that person will not donate or contribute to my charity he will feel like contributing it towards some other charity." "Its like working off field for my project." Its about raising awareness about a mission. Shrida has been an active member in raising awareness, fund raising for lot of projects including but not limited to the hospice center and cancer research institute.</span><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
