<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Hospice Center</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.skandavalehospice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_2214-600px.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.skandavalehospice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_2214-600px.jpg" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Shrida has been very closely associated with the Skanda Vale Hospice, Wales, U.K. She has been running 10 k since the last five years and also has raised funds for the same institute. She introduced us to Skanda vale.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Skanda Vale is a project run by monks and nuns of Skanda Vale Monastery. The project begin in 1988 with offering home care services to terminally ill patients and to people having life limiting conditions. The purpose was to help patients deal with the symptoms, pain and suffering of the terminal days and help them live well before they die.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Hospice is not about a doom and gloom condition. It is not necessarily have to be sick people in bed or ailing surrounded around a loud television. Skanda Vale is more about creating a home away from home with a warm, friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Skanda Vale is about the people finding optimism and sense of normality (and even fun) during a very challenging time of life. Skanda Vale believes in 'We care' apart from just providing medical treatment to patients. It is to provide holistic care and help practically, emotionally, socially and spiritually. It helps patients to cope up with anxiety of death and dying and also supports family during the same phase.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">There is an inpatient center and also day respite care service where people with Cancer, breathing difficulties, Multiple Sclerosis, Lung problems and any Chronic pain patients can come and visit the center. People who know they are going to die soon may be obliged to put a brave face at home to minimize the emotional effects on their family. When patients visit this center they can be themselves and share their pain and mental state of mind with others in a similar state.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">There are various services offered like large lounge, dining area and conservatory, home cooked meal meeting diet specific requirements, hydraulic bath and chair lift for assisted bathing, reflexology, massage and aromatherapy, art and craft workshops, counselling services, spiritual training and beautiful gardens with country side view.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy are incorporated in the rehabilitative care of the inpatients.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">In 2003 Skanda Vale opened in Llandysul. The location is on border of Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion and thus easily accessible to rural community. The projects to develop this hospice have been a continued process. All service and even in patient respite are free of cost to patients. There are no NHS or government grants. All projects are run on donations and fund raising events.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">We realized we would love to be instrumental by our journey to &nbsp;raise awareness for Skanda Vale.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.skandavalehospice.org/">http://www.skandavalehospice.org</a>/</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><ul style="background-color: white; color: #5d534b; line-height: 25px; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;"><li style="line-height: 20px; list-style-type: none; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 18px; padding-top: 5px; position: relative;"><br /></li></ul></div>
