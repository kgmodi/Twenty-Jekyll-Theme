<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Travelling through China</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.china-tour.cn%2Fimages%2FChina-Maps%2Fchina-map-4.gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.china-tour.cn/images/China-Maps/china-map-4.gif" height="160" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">We contacted several travel agencies to inquire about the logistics of driving through China. The primary research showed that China, and Tibet in specific, require elaborate paperwork for self driving trips in China.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">The paperwork and requirements are as follows</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">1. A Temporary Chinese driving license and vehicle number plate are required to drive a foreign registered vehicle in China.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">2. The route should be fixed and approved by the government.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">3. A Chinese guide must accompany the group throughout the trip.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">4. Since 2007, Chinese customs require a vehicle deposit (depending on the value of the car, manufacture year and displacement of the vehicle). The deposit is paid at the entry border/port and is refunded once the vehicle leaves China.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Entry in India can be from</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">1.China - Nepal - India</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">China - Nepal (Zhangmu Kodari) is still closed after the April 25th, 2015 earthquake. Hence it is not possible to enter India from that border.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Another China - Nepal border (Guyrong) is currently open only to tourist groups but not to self-driving vehicles.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">2. China - Sikkim(India)</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nathu La Pass border is only open to Indian pilgrim groups.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">3. There is no established diplomatic relationship between China and Bhutan.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">4. China - Myanmar - India</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">The China - Myanmar (Ruili) Muse border is available at present and thus entering India from Moreh (Manipur - India) is possible.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Kunal, Shrida and I hoped to travel to Mt. Kailash when we are in China. Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar have been of great significance to us while growing up.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">We realized that to travel to Kailash we needed a permit from the National Tourism Administration of China as well as a provincial Xinjiang and Tibet travel permit.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Tibet travel permit (issued by the Tibetian Tourism Bureau) is complicated for Indian passport holders as they need a 'Special permit' (from the China Indian Pilgrim Service Center) to enter Mt. Kailash.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">If &nbsp;we intend to enter from Myanmar and pass through other parts of China, Indian passport holders will also need a 'Normal Tibet permit'.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">And a Normal and Special Tibet permit both are not granted to a person at the same time.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Thus we realized</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- Driving in China requires elaborate paper work.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- It is expensive to have a guide and pay for the custom deposits.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- It is difficult to visit Mt. Kailash.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This gave us second thoughts on</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- Entering India through the Pakistan border</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- To do a back pack trip and avoid the liability of a Car.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- To travel through China straight to Mongolia and then travel south thus avoiding Tibet and the extra expenses.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">After discussions and arguments we decided to stick to the Krygyzstan - China - Myanmar - India route. We decided to look for other travel groups and join with them and thus share the costs.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">We are hoping for stars to work in our favor and the China - Nepal border will open up by August 2016.</span></div></div>
