Vrunda (Kunal's sister) was really excited and had ample of constructive proposals.She was keen on being the on board team member; but for school she would have been on the road. She agreed on her complete backing and help us by all means. Mom had her initial concerns on our safety and the reasoning behind the trip,but soon signed in.Both said they would miss us,especially with Indian festivals like Diwali, Navratri around the corner.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">We shared our idea with two friends of ours Stephen and Cathy, we met at Stephens office to discuss our idea on Dec 12 2015. Our formal first discussion.They are a part of team Last Responders - Adventuring for Charity.The team has been to three cross country rallies so far. Kunal was part of London to Mali trip in 2012. Stephen and Cathy were highly supportive of our journey.We discussed the route,expenses and their personal experiences briefly.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Our research had told us that China is going to be the most difficult and expensive part of the journey.We had realized that driving through China needs to be accompanied by a guide all through.Also it was going to be an expensive affair. Kunal and I were looking forward to visit Kailash mountain while passing through China, as it had always been of great significance while growing up.</span><br /><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"></span></div></div></div>
