Commitment to the challenging program is vital from students, teachers and parents. Education, boarding, meal, clothing, and medical care to more than 100 girls of economically deprived tribal areas are free-of-charge. Every student at Kedi arrives here by choice. Kedi school is now coming up with a new project to provide Scholarship program after 12th for higher education. In this project, the school will offer part payment of fees and scholarships to those who want to continue higher studies. We aim to raise $5000 for the same.
