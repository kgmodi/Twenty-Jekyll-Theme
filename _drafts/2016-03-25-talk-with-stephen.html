<p dir="ltr">March 23<br>After exchanging preliminary&nbsp; emails with Tata motors, we consulted Stephen if he had ideas on how to pitch the plan to Tata motors.<br>He suggested to have a concrete plan on the trip. We should be clear on our route, vehicle and&nbsp; the required help.<br>He had good ideas on marketing. He suggested on the videos we can make when on the journey.</p><p dir="ltr">The one I loved the most was about <br>Asking 3 questions to all three team members<br>1. What are you feeling today <br>2. Why do you want to do the trip</p><p dir="ltr">These questions, put together for 3 months everyday on the trip and then clipped together as a video would be a good one to make.</p>
