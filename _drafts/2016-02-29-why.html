<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Why the trip?</b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.someawesome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/pink-cloud-why.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.someawesome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/pink-cloud-why.gif" height="213" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: left;">The most elementary and vital question was why do we want to do this trip?I should have started of the blog with this.But honestly these thought were more preeminent as we thought more of the trip.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">It appeared crazy and meaningless to some.Quitting jobs, wasting money, unnecessary exposing one selves to dangers were the few of varied responses we got from people.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">But in our heads and hearts we knew why we wanted to do the journey.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Kunal:</div><div style="text-align: left;">The driving force &nbsp;for Kunal behind doing the journey was to experience the excitement of crossing borders and reaching the homeland. He wanted to mimic the silk route.The idea of driving across the countries was fascinating to Kunal. Study,get a job,get married,have kids,buy a home,pay mortgages,get old, retire was not the only thing he was looking at."I want to do something different in my life." "I want to know the meaning and purpose of life. I know I want to do something to help some one."</div><div style="text-align: left;">"On my previous trip 'Timbuktu challenge' London to Mali I learned a lot, I could not finish the last lap due to visa issues, and that is when I decided to drive to India."</div><div style="text-align: left;">Going for a charity mission for a adventure seems the way to go. "Its like running a marathon for a cause." Its like clubbing your passion to be a explorer with the idea of doing good.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Shrida:</div><div style="text-align: left;">Sole purpose and mission of Shrida was to raise awareness about a good cause.She mentioned that as she drives across miles,talking to hundreds of people about her project and mission,she would be sowing a seed of goodness in that individuals mind. "Even if that person will not donate or contribute to my charity he will feel like contributing it towards some other charity." "Its like working off field for my project." Its about raising awareness about a mission. Shrida has been an active member in raising awareness, fund raising for lot of projects including but not limited to the cancer research institute.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Devanshi:</div><div style="text-align: left;">I want to explore,know more about different cultures, see and experience different lands, expect the unexpected, overcome challenges,enjoy natures enormous&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.2px;">meeting new people who speak different languages, experiencing different cultures, exploring different food, facing challenges, encountering different weather conditions, feeling the energy of every city, enjoying natural beauty, learning the history of a new place, appreciating varied architectures and looking towards something new every moment o</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
