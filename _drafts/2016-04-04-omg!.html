<p dir="ltr">Today feels like a lucky day.<br>I have a patient Lisa, who works for the New York post. I described her my project and asked her if she could do something about it. She said she can help connect to someone who can help.<br>Another big one was , I mentioned to Christine about my project. She agreed to donate. And she was randomly talking to me and mentioned that his friend Ravikant, managing director of Tata motors was visiting them on June 10.<br>I was like OMG!<br> With our project in consideration with the marketing director to have a word with the managing director will be HUGE.<br>I hope this is a good opportunity.<br>Time to get more structured and more organized on what is happening.<br>I hope this works.<br>I am extremely hopeful and happy today.<br>Also I found a patient from Czech republic, hopefully will find some contacts <u>later</u></p>
