<p dir="ltr">4/29<br>I don't know what was I thinking.<br>Maybe I do not want any trouble with my release (which did not happen)<br>Or let me tell Paul how cool I am and I can do a trip too<br>I just told him while treating him for his Back that I wanted a 3 month holiday<br>It was like a bomb fell on him and he stated that too.<br>All he could think was 3 months! 3 months?<br>He asked me if I was pregnant!<br>And I told him I plan to drive from London to Mumbai<br>He was not interested in the plan at all<br>All that occurred to him was 3 months<br>And repeated it 20 times<br>He said he can not hold a position for me for that long<br>I said hopefully my review does not get affected by that<br>But he said it would<br>I think mainly why I wanted to tell him was because I did not want to be reflected as a person who mentions after the review and raise that I plam to go on a long holiday<br>Dont know if I did foolishness<br>Or I did the right thing by clearing my conscious out<br>Will his attitude change to me ?<br>Will he not count me in any clinicals decisions?<br>Idk<br>Time will tell<br>Right now it feels I put an axe on my own legs<br>Hoping for the best <br></p>
