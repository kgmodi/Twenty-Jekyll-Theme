<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr">March 3 2016</div><div dir="ltr">It's Thursday; just 2 days left for the weekly meet. I have to find visa requirements for all countries.<br />I have been busy at work, seeing 15-16 patients everyday. Back has been bothering. Physically exhausted. Me and Kunal are so dead by night that both try and massage each other's legs.<br />We were researching for bioluminescent tours in Puerto Rico<br />We forced woke up early and started with laptops in hands<br />Kunal emailed the Tibet tours today, asking if Nepal is opened up, what is the route they suggest. Thinking if we can find other cost quotations.<br />The most important burning topic for the day is - I found out I need letter of invitation for Kyrgyzstan visa. I don't know how to get that. </div><div dir="ltr">I am tensed and&nbsp; anxious.<br />Wondering we have very little time left.<br />I see my CLep book on table.I haven't even opened it.<br />Wondering if I will be able to finish my NJ license before I leave.</div><div dir="ltr">Anand - the guy from overland stories. A family of 4 , had travelled from Bangalore to France. He emailed Kunal today. That was a motivating factor. We looked at his pictures and video. His little 2 nd grade 7 yr girl inspired me to continue with the journey ... </div><div dir="ltr">Spoke to dad today&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr">he asked me to organize myself more. He has always been my creative bank. He asked me to find a name for my group and said I could use full forms for abbreviations.</div></div>
