<p dir="ltr">April 1 2016<br>Kunal mentioned let's put up on fb today. People might feel it's an April fools day joke. It will be fun. I still haven't mentioned it to my employer. I feel I will do that next month. Kunal's HR is not yet aware of the situation. <br>Another alarm that struck was that the clock was ticking! We have 5 months left to the maximum. To overcome the hurricane number of tasks looks challenging.<br>Visas , car, carnet , China and Myanmar permits are pending. <br>I still have my green card application, NJ license application, TOFEL exam pending.<br>The days look short. It is hard to find even some time for self. Errands, chores and social events fill up the calendar. <br>Shrida has been busy lately, and the weekly group meets are going&nbsp; slow. <br>Vrunda came up with few groups which have done a similar journey. 'Drivathon' a charity project for blood cancer was one of them. They drove from London to Mumbai. They traveled through Pakistan. Should we do the same? How safe it is ?<br>Questions and dilemmas ??<br>Hope we make it through. </p>
