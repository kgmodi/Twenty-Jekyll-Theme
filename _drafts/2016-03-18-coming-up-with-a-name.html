<p dir="ltr">18 March 2016</p><p dir="ltr">Deciding and finalising name for the team did not look like a big task when we started with. But on deep thoughts it really looks like a task. We thought that the name of the team would reflect our purpose, our mission and our reason for the trip and hence it can not be just anything.<br> A few of the ideas were as follows</p><p dir="ltr">Team Ojas:<br>Ojas means vigour, energy, vitality. <br>The name did not appeal much to Kunal and dad though.</p><p dir="ltr">Team RAY - Raising awareness amongst youth. <br>This name was driven with the idea that we are a group of young people and doing an event which the youth would be able to connect to and relate too. We can be a small RAY of light from the entire sunshine to spread awareness, raise funds and possibly light up the life of someone.</p><p dir="ltr">Team ACE<br>The perfect abbreviation for our goal behind the trip - Adventure , Charity , Explore</p><p dir="ltr">Team SPARK<br>Spark is produced with confluence of two things and here is the confluence if two ideas of adventure and charity.<br>It's a spark at present which we hope to light up into a fire.<br>Hoping to sparkle someone's life</p><p dir="ltr">Project REACH ,&nbsp; project Kiran were the other names we are thinking of.<br>Need to decide soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Any ideas ? </p>
