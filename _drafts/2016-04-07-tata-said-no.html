<p dir="ltr">April 7 2016 <br>After the development in last few days, we had got really motivated to work. Kunal, shrida, vrunda and I all had been up to various tasks.<br>Vrunda came up with a simple and elegant logo today. She is working on it.<br>Kunal had replied to reshmas email and we heard back on her saying that they calibrated the cost for the trip and sponsorship and their company objectives don't match with the required amount of funds.<br>A disappointment but we still have a Spark within us.<br>I personally am still hopeful to get the car as sponsorship by talking with Mr.Ravikant<br>I feel it will work.<br>Am I in denial ? Or am I over optimistic?<br>All will be well</p>
